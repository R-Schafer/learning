    <h1>Internetting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headins.</p>
  
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make unordered lists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They dont need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is how you make ordered lists:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add an "ol" element</li>
      <li>Note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>This is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a specific word.</p>
    <p>This is how you <strong>bold</strong> your words.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to do both!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Line Breaks</h2>
    <p>You add a "br/" element <br/>Best Regards,<br/> Rainey</p>

    <h2>HR Element</h2>
    <p>If you add an "hr/" element it will seperate the page with a line</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Notice how the line breaks up the page without specifically using the "br/" element </p>
